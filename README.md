# Arithmetic_Formatter
This is a project I had to do for freecodecamp.org to get certified in Scientific Computing with Python.
Python 3.8.7

The aritmetic_arranger is the function. If anyone reads this take a look at it, and if you see something that'll make it fail please let me know. 

The unit tests for freecodecamp on Repl.it shows it displaying correctly, but says it fails. Not sure why it's doing this and I've exhausted myself trying to figure out, especially, when my tests I run don't fail. I could be biased on my tests, butI dont think so.
