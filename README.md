# Arithmetic_Formatter
This is a project I had to do for freecodecamp.org to get certified in Scientific Computing with Python.
Python 3.8.7

The aritmetic_arranger is the function. If anyone reads this take a look at it, and if you see something that'll make it fail please let me know. 

The unit tests for freecodecamp on Repl.it shows it displaying correctly, but says it fails. Not sure why it's doing this and I've exhausted myself trying to figure out, especially, when my tests I run don't fail. I could be biased on my tests, butI dont think so.

This function is to take five addition or subtraction problems or less and format it vertically and align them to the right. It, also, determines whether there is an operand other than '+' or '-' , only digits are in each problem, and the numbers are four digits or less. There is an optional argument to show the solutions to each problem, and its aligned automatically.
